We are focusing on building small prototypes to test if we can all collab as a team.

We will start by building simple levels where characters can move and eventually throw snowballs at eachother.

We will need to build small assets or find assets.

We will need a team of programmers to build the architecture and scripts for the game.

We will need a designer to design the player experience of the game.

We will need a level designer to build the world in Unreal.

Here is the place for everythign to take place.

If we can build a simple level and manage to get online multiplayer on then we can move towards our first game development project.
